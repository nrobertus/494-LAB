# TaCo Company Website

##Purpose

This site is to provide users with a way to get information about the TaCo Company, see menu items, and get to know the staff a little better. 
It also provides contact information and customer testimonials. It's a basic promotional website, with a centrailzed, simplistic theme.

##Target users/audience

The target demographic would be those who would be inclined to look up a website for a restaurant. This generally includes a younger crowd.
It is not aimed at youth, however, as it is not flashy or colorful. The aim is the mid twenties to mid thirties age range, as a layout like this
seems like it would appeal to them most.

##Visual design requirements

The visual design is a simple, clean, hand-drawn look. This plays into the idea of a hometown restaurant, while still feeling like a company that knows what they are doing.

The fonts used are AmaticSC-Regular, Amatic-Bold, and helvetica ( a bootstrap default. )

The colors are #666 for big headings, #999 for small headings, #3c3c3c for hovered links, and #ccc for hr elements and spacing lines.

The menu images are clean .png files with the item cut out and a drop shadow applied. The bio photos are simple headshots with circular frames.

##Basic site structure

The header element has the logo above and the navigation below. 

The footer element has copyright info and a button to get back to the top.

The home page has client testimonials.

The About Us page has a mission statement and staff bios.

The Menu page has names, descriptions and images of the menu items.

The Contact Us page has an address, emails for the staff, and social media links.

##Key words and informational phrases

##Bonus features

There's a section in the header of index.html that is commented out right now. If you uncomment that, the cursor is a taco.

At the bottom of the page, there is an elevator button. If resize the window so that the page is very long, scroll to the bottom, and click the elevator button, it will play some elevator music, scroll to the top, and ding when you get there.
